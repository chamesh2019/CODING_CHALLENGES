# Challenge 821 - Get the Date

Write a function that, given a date (in the format `MM/DD/YYYY`), returns the day of the week as a string. Each day name must be one of the following strings: `"Sunday"`, `"Monday"`, `"Tuesday"`, `"Wednesday"`, `"Thursday"`, `"Friday"`, or `"Saturday"`.

To illustrate, the day of the week for `"12/07/2016"` is `"Wednesday"`.

## Examples
```python
get_day("12/07/2016") ➞ "Wednesday"

get_day("09/04/2016") ➞ "Sunday"

get_day("12/08/2011") ➞ "Thursday"
```
